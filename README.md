# Steam Screenshot Organizer

Currently Steam saves screenshots as {app_id}_{timestamp}. This is annoying because trying to find any screenshots is a guessing game based on the thumbnails (or if you know the app id).
This solves that problem by reorganizing your Steam pictures directory into their app title as a folder and then their timestamp as the filename.
No idea if this breaks uploading to steam screenshots, but I don't use it myself.
